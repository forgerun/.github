ForgeRun is a neutral transparency protocol for verifiable governance evidence. It defines a public, append-only way to record that a governance-relevant decision occurred, what evidence was produced, and how that evidence can be independently verified—without requiring trust in the operator. ForgeRun is intentionally limited to mechanical, falsifiable properties such as structure, cryptographic integrity, ledger inclusion, and timestamps. It provides a protocol specification, not a service, and does not make judgments about correctness, policy compliance, safety, or intent. All verification is read-only and may be performed by independent third parties.

See the [ForgeRun Specification (v1.0.0)](https://github.com/forgerun/spec/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for the canonical protocol definition.
